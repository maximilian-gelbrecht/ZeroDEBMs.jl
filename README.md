[![Build Status](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/ZeroDEBMs.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/ZeroDEBMs.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

Demonstration of the solutions of Exercise 7 for the [Modelling and Machine Learning of Dynamical Systems in Julia class](https://github.com/TUM-PIK-ESM/TUM-Dynamics-Lecture) at TU Munich. 

This repository features zero dimensional energy balance models (0D-EBMs) as presented in the lecture. The package implements those models and [the Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/ZeroDEBMs.jl/blob/main/exercise7-solutions.ipynb) explores their dynamics and presents the solutions.
